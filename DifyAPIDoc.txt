Developing with APIs
Dify offers a "Backend-as-a-Service" API, providing numerous benefits to AI application developers. This approach enables developers to access the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) directly in frontend applications without the complexities of backend architecture and deployment processes.
Benefits of using Dify API
Allow frontend apps to securely access LLM capabilities without backend development
Design applications visually with real-time updates across all clients
Well-encapsulated original LLM APIs
Effortlessly switch between LLM providers and centrally manage API keys
Operate applications visually, including log analysis, annotation, and user activity observation
Continuously provide more tools, plugins, and knowledge
How to use
Choose an application, and find the API Access in the left-side navigation of the Apps section. On this page, you can view the API documentation provided by Dify and manage credentials for accessing the API.
API document
You can create multiple access credentials for an application to deliver to different users or developers. This means that API users can use the AI capabilities provided by the application developer, but the underlying Prompt engineering, knowledge, and tool capabilities are encapsulated.
In best practices, API keys should be called through the backend, rather than being directly exposed in plaintext within frontend code or requests. This helps prevent your application from being abused or attacked.
For example, if you're a developer in a consulting company, you can offer AI capabilities based on the company's private database to end-users or developers, without exposing your data and AI logic design. This ensures a secure and sustainable service delivery that meets business objectives.
Text-generation application
These applications are used to generate high-quality text, such as articles, summaries, translations, etc., by calling the completion-messages API and sending user input to obtain generated text results. The model parameters and prompt templates used for generating text depend on the developer's settings in the Dify Prompt Arrangement page.
You can find the API documentation and example requests for this application in Applications -> Access API.
For example, here is a sample call an API for text generation:
cURL
Python
Copy
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.dify.ai/v1/completion-messages'
 --header 'Authorization: Bearer ENTER-YOUR-SECRET-KEY'
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
 --data-raw '{
"inputs": {},
"response_mode": "streaming",
"user": "abc-123"
}'
Conversational Applications
Conversational applications facilitate ongoing dialogue with users through a question-and-answer format. To initiate a conversation, you will call the chat-messages API. A conversation_id is generated for each session and must be included in subsequent API calls to maintain the conversation flow.
Key Considerations for conversation_id:
Generating the
conversation_id
: When starting a new conversation, leave the conversation_id field empty. The system will generate and return a new conversation_id, which you will use in future interactions to continue the dialogue.
Handling
conversation_id
in Existing Sessions: Once a conversation_id is generated, future calls to the API should include this conversation_id to ensure the conversation continuity with the Dify bot. When a previous conversation_id is passed, any new inputs will be ignored. Only the query is processed for the ongoing conversation.
Managing Dynamic Variables: If there is a need to modify logic or variables during the session, you can use conversation variables (session-specific variables) to adjust the bot's behavior or responses.
You can access the API documentation and example requests for this application in Applications -> Access API.
Here is an example of calling the chat-messages API:
cURL
Python
Copy
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.dify.ai/v1/chat-messages'
 --header 'Authorization: Bearer ENTER-YOUR-SECRET-KEY'
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
 --data-raw '{
"inputs": {},
"query": "eh",
"response_mode": "streaming",
"conversation_id": "1c7e55fb-1ba2-4e10-81b5-30addcea2276",
"user": "abc-123"
}'

Chat App API
Chat applications support session persistence, allowing previous chat history to be used as context for responses. This can be applicable for chatbot, customer service AI, etc.

Authentication
The Service API uses API-Key authentication. Strongly recommend storing your API Key on the server-side, not shared or stored on the client-side, to avoid possible API-Key leakage that can lead to serious consequences.
For all API requests, include your API Key in the AuthorizationHTTP Header, as shown below:
Code
 Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}

Description
Allows the entry of various variable values defined by the App. The inputs parameter contains multiple key/value pairs, with each key corresponding to a specific variable and each value being the specific value for that variable. Default {}
Name
response_mode
Type
string
Description
The mode of response return, supporting:
streaming Streaming mode (recommended), implements a typewriter-like output through SSE (Server-Sent Events).
blocking Blocking mode, returns result after execution is complete. (Requests may be interrupted if the process is long) Due to Cloudflare restrictions, the request will be interrupted without a return after 100 seconds. Note: blocking mode is not supported in Agent Assistant mode
Name
user
Type
string
Description
User identifier, used to define the identity of the end-user for retrieval and statistics. Should be uniquely defined by the developer within the application.
Name
conversation_id
Type
string
Description
Conversation ID, to continue the conversation based on previous chat records, it is necessary to pass the previous message's conversation_id.
